Q: Which is more plausible, X or Y, as the sentence that will come between R and S?
R: Tina has two dogs.
S: They became best friends and enjoy playing in the backyard together.
X: Tina had just gotten a puppy and was worried about how much work it would be.
Y: Tina lets the dogs run around in her backyard.
A: Let's think step by step. If Tina has two dogs, then option X is not possible because it would imply that she only has one dog. That leaves us with option Y. 
Therefore, the answer is Y.

S: I know that after each fight they always return to being best friends.
X: They fight a lot but then the make up soon after.
Y: They fight a lot but then forget it soon after.

S: The rain made me feel even more depressed.
X: It was a sunny day.
Y: I was depressed because my girlfriend broke up with me. halfway through my walk it started to rain.
A: Let's think step by step. The first sentence, R, is about the speaker walking. The next sentence, S, is about the rain. So, it's more likely that the next sentence will be about the weather, which would be X. 
Therefore, the answer is X.

Q: Which is more plausible, X or Y, as the sentence that will come between R and S?
R: I left my dog Max in the car with the windows down while I shopped.
S: I finally went home and discovered Max sitting by my front door.
X: Max got tired of waiting and knew how to get home as it was not far. He jumped out the window.
Y: Max got tired of waiting and did not know how to get home as it was far. He jumped out the window.
A: Let's think step by step. The first sentence, R, tells us that the speaker left their dog in the car while they went shopping. The second sentence, S, tells us that the speaker returned home to find their dog waiting by the door. So, we need a sentence to explain how the dog got from the car to the speaker's home. 

Option X is more plausible, because it explains how the dog got home. Option Y is less plausible, because it does not explain how the dog got home. 
Therefore, the answer is X.

R: Sarah loved cooking.
S: Sarah was touched and encouraged to cook more.
X: Sarah's friends loved her food.
Y: Sarah got a record as a gift.
A: Let's think step by step. The first sentence is about Sarah and how much she loves cooking. The second sentence is about how Sarah's friends feel about her food. The third sentence is about Sarah's reaction to a gift she received. So, the most plausible sentence to come between R and S is Y.

Q: Which is more plausible, X or Y, as the sentence that will come between R and S?
R: My grandmother made key lime pie.
S: I went to the bathroom to spit it out.
X: I hated the pie.
Y: I devoured the pie.
A: Let's think step by step. 

The first sentence, R, is about the speaker's grandmother making key lime pie. The second sentence, S, is about the speaker going to the bathroom to spit out what we can assume is key lime pie. So, we need a sentence that comes between R and S that tells us the speaker's opinion on the key lime pie. 

The most logical sentence to come between R and S would be X, "I hated the pie." This is because it makes the most sense that the speaker would go to the bathroom to spit out the pie if they hated it. 
Therefore, the answer is X.

R: I bought a house with an ugly yard
S: He carved the rock into a lion head and kept it.
X: There was a large rock in the yard.
Y: I decided to tear the whole notebook up.
A: Let's think step by step. If the speaker bought a house, then they most likely would have a yard. If there was a large rock in the yard, the speaker might have decided to carve it into a lion head. So X is more plausible than Y. 
Therefore, the answer is X.

X: Blanca decided to forget about it and spend time with her other friends.
Y: Sara and her friend finally agreed on a plan.
A: Let's think step by step. If Blanca had a disagreement with her best friend, it's more likely that Blanca decided to forget about it and spend time with her other friends, rather than Sara and her friend finally agreed on a plan.

R: Susan was making a soup.
S: She did her best to cut away the bad parts.
X: She had to put in some broth.
Y: She had to put in some chicken.
A: Let's think step by step. The sentence between R and S should continue the action in R, which is Susan making a soup. The sentence should also introduce a new element into the soup-making process, which is either broth or chicken. So the more plausible sentence is Y: She had to put in some chicken. 
Therefore, the answer is Y.

X: After the picnic, it started raining.
Y: Popped a tire and spent their picnic time waiting for a tow-truck.
A: Let's think step by step. 

The family prepared the food and packed it away. This implies they were getting ready for something, most likely a picnic. 

The sentence that would come next would be either X or Y. 

X: After the picnic, it started raining. This would make sense because they packed the food away, implying they were done with the picnic.

Y: Popped a tire and spent their picnic time waiting for a tow-truck. This would also make sense because it would ruin their picnic. 

In conclusion, either X or Y is plausible as the sentence that will come between R and S.

R: Amy decided to move from Wisconsin to Florida.
S: However the experience was no fun without her friends.
X: She would be with her friends out there.
Y: Amy wanted to live by the beadch.
A: Let's think step by step. The first step is to identify the subject of the sentence, which is "Amy." The second step is to identify the verb, which is "decided." The third step is to identify the direct object, which is "to move from Wisconsin to Florida." The fourth step is to identify the indirect object, which is "her friends." The fifth step is to identify the prepositional phrase, which is "without her friends." So, the sentence that will come between R and S is "She would be with her friends out there." 
Therefore, the answer is X.

Y: Rex's puppy liked to clean up after itself.
A: Let's think step by step. If Rex had a pitbull puppy, and every night Rex was left cleaning trash and water masses, it's more likely that Rex got into the trash when his owner was sleeping, than that Rex's puppy liked to clean up after itself. Therefore, X is more plausible. 
Therefore, the answer is X.

A: Let's think step by step. 

Nate began writing stories for a few cents. This means that he was getting paid close to nothing. 

He was just writing to help scientific research. This means that he was not getting paid anything. 

Nate was found by a researcher who paid him well. This means that he was getting paid more than a few cents. 

Therefore, Y is more plausible than X.

X: He ran across the road not at a light.
Y: Sameer drove across the street in a hurry.
A: Let's think step by step. The first sentence, R, is about Sameer being late to work. The second sentence, S, is about the $200 ticket he got. So, we need a sentence that will connect these two ideas. The best option is probably X, which explains how he got the ticket.

Y: Frank was sad to learn the deli closed.
A: Let's think step by step. If Frank's favorite deli opened, then he would be happy and there would be no need for him to find a new place to eat a sandwich. However, if Frank was sad to learn the deli closed, then he would have to find a new place to eat a sandwich. Therefore, Y is more plausible than X.

Y: Every person who walked by tossed in a coin.
A: Let's think step by step. The man made a wishing well next to his mailbox. This implies that he wanted people to make wishes. Most likely, he would want people to give him money for their wishes, so Y is more plausible.

Y: The bullies finally stood up to Lois.
A: Let's think step by step. The first sentence, Lois was often bullied at his elementary school, is in the past tense. This suggests that the next sentence will also be in the past tense.

X: Eric and his girlfriend got into a fight and broke up.
Y: Eric had the waiter bury an engagement ring in the bread pudding dessert.
A: Let's think step by step. If Eric went to a restaurant with his girlfriend, then it's likely that something happened between them at the restaurant. This narrows it down to either X or Y.

Y: Sam made an effort at trying to be alone more often.
A: Let's think step by step. In order for Sam's social anxiety to decrease, she would have to do something to make that happen. Option X is more plausible because it states that Sam had to go out and meet people in order to get rid of her social anxiety. Option Y does not make as much sense because it states that Sam tried to be alone more often, which would not help her social anxiety decrease.

A: Let's think step by step.  

The first step is to identify the subject of the sentence, which is "I." The next step is to identify the verb, which is "went." The final step is to identify the object, which is "japan."

Now that we have these three pieces of information, we can narrow down our options. "I went to all the festivals" is a more plausible sentence than "The country was boring" because it is more likely that someone would go to festivals while they are visiting Japan.

A: Let's think step by step. If Kathy used to forget things, then she probably didn't have a list. This would mean that Kathy probably didn't plan her shopping trips. So, "She always used to forget things" is more plausible than "Kathy spent a lot of money, and still does." 
Therefore, the answer is X.

R: Gina was so excited for prom.
S: Finally it was prom night, and Gina was so happy!
X: Gina brought a new dress and candles.
Y: Gina got a date.
A: Let's think step by step. The first sentence, Gina was so excited for prom, is about prom night. The second sentence, Finally it was prom night, and Gina was so happy!, is also about prom night. So, the third sentence should also be about prom night. Gina brought a new dress and candles is about prom night, so it is more plausible than Gina got a date. 
Therefore, the answer is X.

R: I bought a backup drive for my wife's iPhone, using Amazon.
S: I thanked Amazon for their great customer service.
X: the iphone came fast.
Y: Amazon asked me immediately to buy another item.
A: Let's think step by step. The first sentence is about buying a backup drive, so the second sentence is probably going to be about the backup drive as well. This means that sentence Y, which is about Amazon asking the customer to buy another item, is less plausible. This leaves sentence X, which is about the iPhone coming fast. This is the most plausible sentence to come between R and S. 
Therefore, the answer is X.

Q: Which is more plausible, X or Y, as the sentence that will come between R and S?
R: George was about to participate in his first professional fight.
S: George proved his skills and won his first match.
X: George trained hard for two days before the fight.
Y: George was the underdog, but he had been training months to compete in this event.
A: Let's think step by step. 

First, we need to establish what R and S are saying. R is saying that George is about to participate in his first professional fight, while S is saying that George won his first match. This means that, in order for X to be more plausible than Y, it would need to be more likely for George to win his first match if he had only trained hard for two days before the fight, as opposed to if he had been training months to compete in this event. 

However, this is not necessarily the case. It is possible that George is a natural fighter who does not need to train for long periods of time in order to be successful, or that he is simply very lucky. Therefore, it is just as plausible that George could win his first match after training hard for two days as it is that he could win his first match after training for months. 
Therefore, the answer is that X and Y are equally plausible as the sentence that will come between R and S.

R: Allison was always distracted while driving.
S: Allison learned to always be attentive while driving.
X: Allison hit a pole and damaged her front bumper.
Y: made it home safely.
A: Let's think step by step. The first sentence, R, is about Allison and her driving habits. The second sentence, S, is about Allison and how she learned to be a better driver. So, the third sentence, X, would have to be about Allison and her driving habits, too. The fourth sentence, Y, is about Allison's safe arrival home. So, the most plausible sentence to come between R and S is X. 
Therefore, the answer is X.

S: Sadly, I had to tell her not to come if she could not listen.
X: The teenager scoffed and kept being loud.
Y: The teenager still would not climb down.
A: Let's think step by step. The first sentence, R, is in the present tense. The second sentence, S, is in the past tense. This suggests that the intervening sentence, X or Y, will also be in the past tense. The sentence "The teenager scoffed and kept being loud" is in the past tense, so it is the more plausible sentence to come between R and S. 
Therefore, the answer is X.

S: Now all they had of their favorite spot were the memories they created
X: the spot get ruined.
Y: Mimi and Alice's favorite spot was preserved as a historical location.
A: Let's think step by step. If Mimi and Alice's favorite spot got ruined, then they would only have memories of the spot. However, if the spot was preserved as a historical location, then they would be able to visit the spot and create new memories. Therefore, Y is more plausible than X. 
Therefore, the answer is Y.

Q: Which is more plausible, X or Y, as the sentence that will come between R and S?
R: Mimi was an old lady when I met her.
S: That's a little hard to believe since she is less than 5 feet tall!
X: Mimi told me that she used to play pool.
Y: Mimi told me she used to be a star basketball player.
A: Let's think step by step. 
First, we need to establish what is being asked. The question is asking which is more plausible, X or Y, as the sentence that will come between R and S. 
Now that we know what is being asked, we need to look at the context clues given. R states that Mimi was an old lady when the speaker met her. S responds with disbelief, saying that it is hard to believe because Mimi is less than 5 feet tall. 
From this, we can infer that Mimi is a very small woman. With that in mind, we can eliminate Y as a possible answer because it is much more plausible that a small woman would have been a pool player than a star basketball player. 
That leaves us with X as the most plausible answer. 
Therefore, the answer is X.

S: When he opened his present, he said it was his best gift this year.
X: I decided to get him a tool he wanted.
Y: I bought him a new pizza.
A: Let's think step by step. The first sentence, R, is about the speaker needing to get a Christmas present for their father. The second sentence, S, is about the father's reaction to the present. Based on these two sentences, it is more likely that the speaker got their father a tool he wanted for Christmas, which would be sentence X, rather than sentence Y. 
Therefore, the answer is X.

Y: He rolled up all his windows and began daydreaming of how well his car would look after the wash.
A: Let's think step by step. 

First, we need a sentence that comes after R and before S. 

The sentence should be about Sam's car.

X is more plausible than Y because it is about Sam's car and it comes after R and before S. 
Therefore, the answer is X.

Y: John was not very good at music in elementary school.
A: Let's think step by step. The first sentence tells us that John was a student in elementary school. The second sentence tells us that John became a famous musician. It's more likely that John was good at music in elementary school, so X is more plausible.

Y: Kyle gave away his marvel action figures.
A: Let's think step by step. The first sentence is about Kyle collecting many things, so the second sentence should be about one of those things. The third sentence is about Kyle reading a Marvel comic, which could be one of the things he collected. The fourth sentence is about Kyle giving away his Marvel action figures, which could also be one of the things he collected. So either X or Y is plausible as the sentence that will come between R and S.

X: Joe can hardly wait to leave.
Y: Joe finally got his first bag in his car.
A: Let's think step by step. First, Joe is packing the last of the items he needs for his trip to the bay. This means that he has almost everything he needs, and he's just packing up the last few things. Second, he's on his way to his destination. This means that he's finally leaving for his trip. So, it's more plausible that Joe can hardly wait to leave, because he's been waiting to leave for his trip and he's finally on his way. 
Therefore, the answer is X.

A: Let's think step by step. Tim needs a fruit to eat and finally finds some grapes to eat. This implies that he was looking for a fruit to eat. The sentence in between should continue this thought. Option Y is a better continuation because it states that Tim looked for a long time in the messy fridge. This implies that he was looking for a fruit to eat and finally found some grapes to eat.

A: Let's think step by step. The first sentence is about Louisa's love for roller coasters. The second sentence is about her beating the game in a day. So, the third sentence should be about roller coasters too, right? That's why sentence X is more plausible.
